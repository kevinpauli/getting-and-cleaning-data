The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

It reads the source dataset, combines the test and training data sets, then selects only variables that represent mean and standard deviations.  It then groups the data by activity and subject, calculates the mean for the variables in question, and writes the result to sol.txt.

The codebook for the resulting solution file is at './codebook.txt'
